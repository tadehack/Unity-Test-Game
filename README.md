# Unity-Test-Game
This is an old unity project that I was messing with back in 2022, this was supposed to be an "FPS Survival Horror" based game, where the player would start on a forest and then make their way to an underground tunnel system, where there would be some puzzles to be solved and some spooky stuff going on, but as it turns out, I didn't even get to finish the first area of the game, and I quickly found out that this was going to be a huge learning curve if I wanted to continue it's development.  
Everything you see in the game is in an extremely early development state, there are some glitches that can be easily reproduced as well, like the "infinite jumping bug" and also "vertical prop boost" (as i like to call them).  

You can find a wooden bridge behind the locked gate, the idea was to make a cool looking view with a waterfall that would come out of the right side mountain and it would go under the bridge and into a river to the left side. This bridge would lead the player into finding some abandoned buildings and then the underground tunnel. The tunnel would be closed with some very rusty fences and one of them would be fallen on the ground, therefore allowing the player to get inside. The idea of the starting area was to create a sense of suspense and loneliness to the player before getting into the tunnel.

There are more stuff that I want to explain here but I'm kinda lazy rn, maybe I'll finish it later.
